Our challenge was to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address location we used IP Geolocation API. To generate the map, we used Leaflet JS.

 This project is built with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript . Tech stack is a part of web development. 
Web development refers to the building, creating, and maintaining of websites on the internet.
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language is a language that provides a structure or skeleton to any website. 
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is used to make a website visually appealing. It plays an important part in UI or User Interface. 
JavaScript makes a website dynamic and plays an important role in UX or User Experience, and makes user-website interaction ( like data-sending/data-receiving)     possible.

In addition to this we use host and deploy our URL using Versel. We also use APIs like Leaflet JS and IP Geolocation to identify visitors via IP address. 
Further we us React js, a JavaScript library developed by Facebook used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently
